# About this Repository

This is my contribution to my group's Data Mining project. I utilized feature engineering to make some of our other classification models more effective. To measure the increase in effectiveness I pitted multiple versions of the dataset (raw, combined, and engineered) against each other using a naive bayes classifier.

The full project repo is privated due to plagiarism concerns.
